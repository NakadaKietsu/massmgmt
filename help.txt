The massmgmt suite runs off of launch daemons controlled by the Apple Inc. service
Launchd. Most of the scripts are intended to be run at startup and are lightweight.
If no action must be taken, the script the launch daemon runs will exit quickly. 
Typically, any files that are generated by massmgmt will be placed in /tmp unless
they are meant to represent more permanent variables. Persistant files will be 
stored in the locations recommended by Apple Inc.

-----

The massmgmt tool has logging built into the many scripts that are included. The
log storage directory is /Users/<admin user>/Library/Logs/massmgmt/. Logs may also be
flushed by entering the command:

$ massmgmt flushLogs

when logged in as the UID=501 admin user.

The main directory for storing scripts is /usr/local/massmgmt/bin. Additional
scripts are located in /usr/local/massmgmt/sbin. The help documentation and main
script called be the LaunchDaemon are located in /usr/local/massmgmt/.
